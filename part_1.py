print(sample_bay[len(sample_bay)-1])
#first element in sample_bay list is numbered at 0/zero. so the four elements are numbered 0 to 3 respectively. to print the last element we say count the number of elements 1,2,3,4 then subtract 1 this gives 3 now find the element numbered at this number (find the 3rd element in the list). sample_bay goes before so we now which list we are using.
print(len(sample_bay))
# here we just ask to print number of elements in sample_bay list
